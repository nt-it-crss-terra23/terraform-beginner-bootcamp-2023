    <h1>How to make Hungarian Lecso</h1>
    <div>Lecso (pronounced leh-choh) is a veggie stew that contains three of Hungary's favourite ingredients - peppers, tomatoes and paprika.  </div>
    <br>
    Lecso has many variations, it can be served as a main dish or as a side too. For breakfast or lunch it is usually eaten with bread, or supplemented with other ingredients such as sausage, noodles, etc.
    <br>
    Many people preserve lecso by processing it in a hot water bath and it can be used in winter months.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
  <li>6 medium tomatoes cubed</li>
  <li>bell peppers (yellow or red)</li>
  <li>2 medium onions thinly sliced</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika powder</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
</ul>  
       
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>In a pot, sauté the thinly sliced onions in vegetable oil over low heat, stirring frequently, until translucent. Do not let them burn. Salt lightly to help tenderize them. Add a small amount of water, if necessary, to keep them from sticking to the pan.</li>

  <br>
  <li>Add the cubed tomatoes, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>

  <br>
  <li>Add the peppers (cut into medium sized pieces) and 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika powder, sprinkle with ground black pepper and cook for another 5-8 minutes. I do not like to overcook, because then the skin of the peppers cook off. Cooking tip: Do not burn the paprika, or it will become bitter.</li>
